## Varieties

In 2024, several new rice varieties are being introduced in Kenya to enhance production and address food security challenges. The Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) has played a pivotal role in this initiative, collaborating with the Lake Basin Development Authority (LBDA) and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The key varieties being introduced include:

- Komboka: This variety is designed to thrive in various climatic conditions and is expected to significantly boost yields compared to traditional varieties.
 - 08FAN10 (Mkombozi): This variety matures in approximately 85 to 90 days, which is significantly shorter than the conventional varieties that take over 120 days. It is aimed at increasing productivity and reducing production costs.
 - CSR36: Set to be introduced later in the year, this variety is also expected to mature quickly and provide higher yields, making it suitable for farmers looking to maximize their output.

These new varieties are part of a broader strategy to improve rice production in Kenya, which currently faces a significant shortfall in meeting domestic demand. The introduction of these climate-resistant and high-yielding varieties is expected to help farmers increase their incomes and improve food security across the country

## Weather condition

The weather patterns for rice production in Kisumu County, Kenya, in 2024 are shaped by several key factors, particularly concerning rainfall and temperature forecasts.
Rainfall Forecast:

- Long Rains Season: The forecast for May 2024 indicates that Kisumu County, located in the Lake Victoria Basin, is expected to receive near-average to above-average rainfall. This region typically benefits from the Long Rains season, which peaks in April and continues into May, providing crucial water resources for rice farming.
- Continued Rainfall into June: The climate outlook suggests that rainfall will continue into June 2024, which is beneficial for rice crops that require consistent moisture during their growth stages. This extended rainfall period can help improve soil moisture levels, crucial for rice production.
- Potential for Flooding: While the increased rainfall is beneficial, it also raises concerns about potential flooding, which could damage infrastructure and disrupt farming activities. Farmers may need to implement measures to mitigate flood risks.

Temperature Trends:

- Warmer Temperatures: The forecast indicates that temperatures across Kenya, including Kisumu County, are expected to be warmer than usual during this period. Warmer temperatures can affect crop growth and development, necessitating careful management practices to ensure optimal rice yields.

## Planting

Should be done at the onset of rains for rain-fed rice, direct seeding is done in this case. For irrigated rice, raise seedlings on nursery and transplant 3-4 weeks after sowing depending on the variety. Spacing for rain fed rice range between 23-35cm by drill (seed rate 50kg per hectare), for irrigated rice is 15cm-20cm by 20cm (seed rate 50-54kg per hectare).
NB: Flood the field 15 days after tillage, before transplanting.

## Fertilizer application

Nursery: Apply 160kg SA/DAP per hectare.

Irrigated rice: Use basal application method, 100kg DAP per hectare during planting, top dress 12-14 days after transplanting with 100kg CAN per hectare for black cotton soil, 100-180kg SA depending on soil conditions.

Rain-fed rice: Use basal application method, 100kg DAP per hectare during planting and 90kg CAN per hectare during top-dressing. Weed management

For rain fed rice carry out weeding three times, first weeding done 2-3 weeks after germination, second prior to topdressing and third one before panicle set. Use herbicides such as Satonil or Karachi.

## Pest management

- White rice borer: Practice good field hygiene, plant resistant varieties, use systemic insecticides such as confidor.

- Birds: Quelea quelea bird, use bird scaring devices, monitor regularly for breeding sites, report to agricultural office for assistance.

- Rice stem borer:Plant resistant varieties, practice good field hygiene, use systemic insecticides eg confidor.

- Stalk eyed fly: Use systemic insecticides eg confidor.

- Rice leaf hoppers: Use insecticides such as endosulfan.

NB: Chemical control measure should be adopted when pest damage is severe!

## Disease management

- Blast: Plant resistant varieties, proper plant spacing, avoid excessive nitrogen application in the field, practice good field hygiene.

- Sheath blight: Plant resistant varieties, use suitable broad-based fungicide eg ridomil.

- Rice yellow mottle virus: Plant resistant varieties, practice good field hygiene, control insect vectors.

- Sheath rot: Plant resistant varieties, use fungicides eg ridomil.

## Harvesting

Done 80-180 days after sowing depending on varieties and location. Dry the rice to 14% moisture content. Yield range from 4.5 to 10 tons per hectare for irrigated rice and 3-7 tons per hectare for rain-fed rice.
##  Climate-smart technologies

1. Upland Rice Cultivation
Upland rice varieties are being promoted, particularly in Eastern Kenya. These varieties are designed to thrive in drier conditions and require less water, making them suitable for areas with limited irrigation. Farmers have reported increased incomes and improved food security by switching from traditional crops like maize to upland rice, which matures within three to four months.
2. Direct Seeding Technology
Farmers are encouraged to adopt direct seeding methods, which eliminate the need for nursery preparation. This technology saves time and labor, allowing farmers to plant rice directly in the field. It is particularly beneficial in reducing production costs and labor requirements compared to traditional transplanting methods.
3. Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
The introduction of climate-smart rice varieties is complemented by IPM practices that minimize pesticide use while effectively managing pests. This approach promotes sustainable farming by reducing the environmental impact and improving soil health, which is crucial in the face of climate change.
4. Soil Health Management
Farmers are being trained in practices that enhance soil health, such as incorporating legumes into crop rotations. This not only improves soil fertility but also reduces greenhouse gas emissions associated with rice production. Healthy soils are vital for maintaining productivity in changing climatic conditions.
5. Training and Capacity Building
Over the past two years, thousands of smallholder farmers have received training on these climate-smart technologies. This education empowers farmers to adopt new practices effectively, ensuring they can maximize the benefits of the new rice varieties and technologies.
6. Partnerships for Support
Collaborative efforts between organizations like Kilimo Trust, KALRO, and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) are crucial for the successful implementation of these technologies. These partnerships provide resources, training, and support to farmers, facilitating the transition to more sustainable practices
7. Post-Harvest Management
Improving post-harvest handling practices, such as proper drying, storage, and processing, can reduce losses and enhance the quality of rice. Establishing communal storage facilities and seed banks can also support farmers' resilience.
8. Utilization of Technology
Employing mobile applications and weather forecasting tools can assist farmers in making informed decisions regarding planting, irrigation, and pest management. By implementing these best management practices, rice farmers in Kisumu County can improve their productivity, adapt to climate challenges, and contribute to food security in the region.

. These climate-smart technologies, combined with the introduction of new rice varieties, aim to significantly enhance rice production in Kenya, addressing both food security and the challenges posed by climate change.
